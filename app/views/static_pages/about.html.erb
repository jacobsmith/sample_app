    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>ThankTheTeacher.com facilitates the funding and ordering of Gift Cards for our teachers and coaches. We help Gift Card Organizers create a custom web page <%= link_to "(here's an example)", @campaign %> where parents may select how much they would like to gift and who they would like to gift to. Then we sum up the contributions and help the Organizers order Gift Cards and print "thank you" letters that list all of the contributors.</p>

    <h4>Gift Cards & Commissions</h4>
    <p>We get our Gift Cards from Amazon.com. Amazon gives us a 6% commission on  card purchaces. We give <strong>5% cash back</strong> to the organization running the Gift Card Campaign and keep 1% to run the site. Although we do not dictate how commissions are used, our expectation is that Gift Card Campaign Organizers will donate these funds back to their participating organization.</p>

    <div class="well", align="center">
      <em>Example:</em> A $100 Gift Card purchase generates $5.00 for the organization running the Gift Card Campaign.
    </div>

    <h4>Service Fees</h4>
    <p>It costs us about 3% of the transaction to process credit cards on a secure server <em><small>(total price x 3.1% + $.30 to be exact)</small></em>. At checkout, we add a small fee to cover this cost. </p>
    
    <div class="well", align="center">
      <em>Example:</em> A $3.40 service fee will be added to a $100 Gift Card contribution at the time of checkout.
    </div>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>At checkout, credit card information is immediately encrypted and sent directly to our payment processing service Stripe.com. Credit card information is <u>never</u> stored on ThankTheTeacher.com. </p>
