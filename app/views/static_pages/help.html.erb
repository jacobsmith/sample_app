         <h4>Introducing: Amazon Gift Card Program for Example School</h4><br>

        <p>Show our staff how much you appreciate them and share the warmth of the holiday season by contributing to their Amazon gift card account. <br><br>

        Simply click on the links below and choose the staff members and amounts you wish to gift. We will order Amazon gift cards and deliver them to the staff. A note will accompany the cards recognizing the contributor's names. Take the guess work out of gift cards and as a bonus, Amazon will send a percentage of money on orders back to our school. Don't forget your bus driver, specials teachers and school staff too! <br><br>

        Please note this program is being provided as a convenience for our families, and is totally optional.
        </p>
